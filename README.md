Real-time Sentiment Analysis with Apache Kafka and Elasticsearch

The objective of this project is to build a real-time sentiment analysis pipeline using Apache Kafka and Elasticsearch. The pipeline will collect streaming data from Twitter using the Twitter API, perform sentiment analysis on the text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and store the results in Elasticsearch for further analysis and visualization.

The project will involve the following steps:

Collecting streaming data from Twitter using the Twitter API and Apache Kafka.

Using NLP techniques to perform sentiment analysis on the text data.

Integrating the sentiment analysis pipeline with Elasticsearch for storing and indexing the results.

Building a dashboard to visualize the sentiment analysis results in real-time using Kibana.

Deploying the pipeline on a cloud-based infrastructure such as AWS or Google Cloud Platform.

This project will provide hands-on experience in working with big data technologies such as Apache Kafka, Elasticsearch, and NLP, as well as cloud-based infrastructure. It will also provide practical experience in building real-world applications that process and analyze streaming data in real-time.
